This app was built on top of [oldtime.radio](https://oldtime.radio) website API.

*TODO:*

- Design (simplier design w/o images and stuff, bottom with tabs for app and settings, top for channels) []
- Play next show after this one finished (add queue of shows) []
- If app was paused and opened in 5 mins, for example, we should refetch show to current one []
- Create something that looks like cache (for example store channels and after refetching them compare, in such case we are able to show app imidiatelly) []
- Add controls for the lock screen and control center
