*TODO:*

- Design (simplier design w/o images and stuff, bottom with tabs for app and settings, top for channels) [x]
- Play next show after this one finished (add queue of shows) [x]
- If app was paused and opened in 5 mins, for example, we should refetch show to current one []
- Add controls for the lock screen and control center [x]
- Add tags those will open [archive dot org](https://kavsoft.dev/swiftui_2.0_chips)
